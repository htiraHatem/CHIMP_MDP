# CHIMP_MDP (pCHIMP)
Thiswork attempts to extend a hybrid Hierarchical Task Network planner
to perform in a stochastic environment. Our approach presents
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) as a solution to extend the deterministic
Conflict-driven Hierarchical Meta-CSP Planner (CHIMP) domain
into probabilistic Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) one and focus
planning effort on the probabilities of generating plans in the domain.
